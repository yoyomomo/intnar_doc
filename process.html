        <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">Overview</h3>
        <p><i>Where are you?</i> is a transmedia narrative experience that aims to immerse our readers as they traverse through an important event in Robin’s life. The key points and flow of Robin’s story takes inspiration from Jason and the Argonauts, a treasure hunting story that follows Jason’s journey as he goes through many trials and tribulations to obtain the golden fleece for his king. Through his journey he solves different problems and gains new knowledge. This narrative framework was referenced when creating Robin’s adventure to find Sam. Users will travel through different websites and mediums to gather clues and see if Robin can find Sam. This unique experience uses the different websites and mediums to increase the immersion and enjoyment of the experience.

        <h3>Solving a Problem</h3>
        <p>Stories can be lengthy, difficult to comprehend and boring especially a story that’s dated from thousands of years ago. These factors can impact our attention spans when consuming any content. Our main challenge while keeping those factors in mind was how could we make our narrative new and engaging? Thus our goal was to develop an appealing narrative by using today's technology in creative ways such as social media and QR codes to attract our audience. As well as produce a story that is relatable to current generations. As we are accustomed to fast-paced media and are attached to narratives that relate to our current life experiences.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Audience</h3>
        <p>The audience we had in mind when creating <i>Where are you?</i> were youth, from teens to people in their twenties who play “slice of life” video games. However, it can really be enjoyed by everyone of all ages who love stories. Whether they like to read novels or manga, <i>Where are you?</i> is just another way to enjoy narratives in a new, interactive format.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our narrative requires a physical photo to interact with it. We would have dispersed copies of the photo around the Trafalgar campus of Sheridan College if not for the COVID pandemic. Consequently, our audience would have encompassed mainly Sheridan students and faculty, as they are the most likely to encounter the photo. Once they find it, hidden in library books, under keyboards and mouse pads, and placed in other areas around school, they can scan the QR code on the back, which will lead them to the beginning of our narrative: the main website. We hope, with the help of social media, users would share the physical photo with others so <i>Where are you?</i> could reach even larger audiences.

        <h3>Roles And Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>For the project the group divided project deliverables according to each group members skills and abilities. These were determined by using a skills assessment and having group members mention what parts of the project they wanted to take on. For the main illustrations of the project the group analyzed art pieces from each member and unanimously decided on what style suited the project.

        <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
        <p>The main constraints the group faced was not being able to collaborate in person. Due to the pandemic, we weren’t able to properly execute what we wanted to do for the physical interactions that were planned for the project. This also meant the group had to use Zoom as a way of communicating and collaborating on the project. The main issues with using Zoom were unstable internet connections, loud backgrounds, and limited call times.
            <br>
            <br>
            The scope of the project was made with the idea that the project could take place on campus. This meant we wanted an accessible engagement from the audience, such as finding copies of the photo of Sam and Robin. As a group scope we also wanted to ensure we had all the deliverables specified in each project brief so that we could maximize the interaction that our audience would have with the project. The last scope set into place for the project was to ensure the story could be told from beginning to end with the correct number of arcs. This meant the story was considered in multiple ways such as creating a story that was easy or complex, would the audience be able to follow this story, and would the audience be able to understand what the story is trying to show them.

        <h3>Anna's Process</h3>

        <h4>Writing the Story</h4>
        <p>After our team discussed the main elements and plot points of our narrative, I was tasked with writing it. Writing the story from beginning to end without knowing the final details was a major challenge. Early on, I found it very difficult visualizing our end goals and imagining how we would implement the different technologies and platforms that were required. I was afraid to commit to certain plot elements without knowing how we would achieve it, or if it was even possible within our skill sets. Also, changing and retracting decisions was normal for us during the first couple of weeks. This made me hesitate to write because whatever I wrote was subject to change.<br><br>

            However, as the weeks progressed, our team began understanding the project requirements and our individual skills and limitations a lot better. Finalizing decisions became easier, which in turn, made me visualize the story more clearly and write it more confidently. I also learned that writing itself is a process, and constant revision and evolution is a necessary part.</p>

        <h4>Enhancing Experience Through Microinteractions</h4>
        <p>When showing the main website to Steve for our Project 2 presentation, I noticed the result of answering the questions correctly was not very satisfying. Initially, when the user inputed the right answer, the page would abruptly jump straight to the next section. If the user wasn’t paying close attention, they wouldn’t know they did so because the change was so immediate. To fix this, instead of using window.location = ‘#next-section’;, I switched to a timed scrollTop function. This allows the user to see the page scroll to the unlocked section for two seconds, making answering correctly more noticeable and rewarding.<br><br>

            I also added a CSS animation so that when the user unlocks a new chapter, the chapter titles slowly fade in instead of just appearing when the page loads. <br><br>

            I had a similar philosophy for incorrect answers. Before, it was hard to tell when you answered wrong because the “wrong” message appeared below the submit button. If the user didn’t scroll down far enough, they could miss it. So, I added an animation that momentarily changes the border of the input field to red as well. <br><br>
            Another microinteraction I coded was the appearance of the lock icons when the user hovers over locked chapters in the navigation bar. I felt it wasn’t enough to just make those chapters unclickable. Users could easily mistake that as a bug or website error. Adding the lock icons on hover is a clearer indication of locked chapters.<br><br>
            In an earlier version of Chapter 3, I didn’t like how the button that led to Robin’s room was placed above the question. Not only was it visually unappealing, but it would allow the user to skip over Robin’s room and go straight for the question. I addressed this issue by creating a function that hides the question until the user clicks on the button to Robin’s room. This forces the user to view Robin’s room first and answer the question after.

        </p>
        <h4>Necessity of Hints</h4>
        <p>As I was coding and testing the questions, I realized just how specific the users’ answers had to be, and how this specificity could hinder their experience. For example, one of the questions is “What is Sam's old elementary school called?” The correct answer is Martin Grove, but the user may type multiple variations of that answer: Martin Grove School, Martin Grove Public School, etc. Although they are all technically correct, only Martin Grove will unlock the next section. Hinting the number of words per answer addresses this issue, and is a necessity due to the vague nature of the questions.
        </p>
        <h4>Secret Interaction in the Chat</h4>
        <p>When coding the imitation of Facebook Messenger, I realized we didn’t have to limit our “dead ends” and diversions to words on a page or in the decoys of our social media profiles and posts; Interactions could be used as well, or at least, integral to overcoming them. The answer to one of the questions on the website can be found only through a specific interaction with the chat: clicking the input field again after the fifth message appears. However, I purposefully made the prompt for this specific interaction inconspicuous. The previous interactions prompt the user to click the input field by displaying text, but this specific secret interaction does not. Thus, the user could easily miss the interaction and consequently, reach a dead end. <br><br>
            My original idea was more straightforward: The user would click just once to launch the chat. But, as I got more comfortable with Javascript, I wanted to explore more interesting and complex interactions.

        </p>
        <h4>Prioritizing Responsiveness</h4>
        <p>I wasn’t aware of how important responsiveness was until our project manager, Deanna, suggested making the site mobile responsive. Because I’ve always approached my previous coding projects as solely desktop interfaces, I struggled with it. However, it made me understand that responsiveness should always be a priority, not an afterthought—especially for this project since our users need to scan a QR code with their phones. If we had this “mobile-first” approach early on, writing media queries would have been a lot easier because the code written initially was not ideal for responsive design. Nonetheless, after making the site mobile responsive, I challenged myself further by writing more media queries. In total, I used three additional media query breakpoints so that our site was responsive on as many screen sizes as possible.
        </p>
        <h4>Adapting to Lockdown Using Unity</h4>
        <p>Michelle created the prototype of our physical artifact (the photo with the QR code) and took a picture of it because we couldn’t present it in person for Project 2. For the final version of the artifact, I was going to print it on cardstock and have it laminated so it resembled the glossiness of a real photograph. Fortunately, Steve saved me the trip to Staples when he recommended using Unity instead to create and present it. Because using Unity and Blender was not officially part of my role, I had to learn these softwares in a short amount of time. Once I did, the end result was worth it. In a prior version, I wrote a script that rotated the photo only when the user clicked and dragged it, but I felt that interaction wasn’t intuitive without instructions.
