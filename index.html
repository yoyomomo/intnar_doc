        <h3>Overview
        </h3>
        <p><i>Where are you?</i> is a transmedia narrative experience that aims to immerse our readers as they traverse through an important event in Robin’s life. The key points and flow of Robin’s story takes inspiration from Jason and the Argonauts, a treasure hunting story that follows Jason’s journey as he goes through many trials and tribulations to obtain the golden fleece for his king. Through his journey he solves different problems and gains new knowledge. This narrative framework was referenced when creating Robin’s adventure to find Sam. Users will travel through different websites and mediums to gather clues and see if Robin can find Sam. This unique experience uses the different websites and mediums to increase the immersion and enjoyment of the experience.

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Stories can be lengthy, difficult to comprehend and boring especially a story that’s dated from thousands of years ago. These factors can impact our attention spans when consuming any content. Our main challenge while keeping those factors in mind was how could we make our narrative new and engaging? Thus our goal was to develop an appealing narrative by using today's technology in creative ways such as social media and QR codes to attract our audience. As well as produce a story that is relatable to current generations. As we are accustomed to fast-paced media and are attached to narratives that relate to our current life experiences.
        </p>

        <h3>Users and Audience</h3>
        <p>The audience we had in mind when creating <i>Where are you?</i> were youth, from teens to people in their twenties who play “slice of life” video games. However, it can really be enjoyed by everyone of all ages who love stories. Whether they like to read novels or manga, <i>Where are you?</i> is just another way to enjoy narratives in a new, interactive format.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our narrative requires a physical photo to interact with it. We would have dispersed copies of the photo around the Trafalgar campus of Sheridan College if not for the COVID pandemic. Consequently, our audience would have encompassed mainly Sheridan students and faculty, as they are the most likely to encounter the photo. Once they find it, hidden in library books, under keyboards and mouse pads, and placed in other areas around school, they can scan the QR code on the back, which will lead them to the beginning of our narrative: the main website. We hope, with the help of social media, users would share the physical photo with others so <i>Where are you?</i> could reach even larger audiences.

        <h3>Roles And Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>For the project the group divided project deliverables according to each group members skills and abilities. These were determined by using a skills assessment and having group members mention what parts of the project they wanted to take on. For the main illustrations of the project the group analyzed art pieces from each member and unanimously decided on what style suited the project.

        <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
        <p>The main constraints the group faced was not being able to collaborate in person. Due to the pandemic, we weren’t able to properly execute what we wanted to do for the physical interactions that were planned for the project. This also meant the group had to use Zoom as a way of communicating and collaborating on the project. The main issues with using Zoom were unstable internet connections, loud backgrounds, and limited call times.
            <br>
            <br>
            The scope of the project was made with the idea that the project could take place on campus. This meant we wanted an accessible engagement from the audience, such as finding copies of the photo of Sam and Robin. As a group scope we also wanted to ensure we had all the deliverables specified in each project brief so that we could maximize the interaction that our audience would have with the project. The last scope set into place for the project was to ensure the story could be told from beginning to end with the correct number of arcs. This meant the story was considered in multiple ways such as creating a story that was easy or complex, would the audience be able to follow this story, and would the audience be able to understand what the story is trying to show them.
